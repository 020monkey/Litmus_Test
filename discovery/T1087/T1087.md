# T1087 - Account Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1087)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system or domain accounts. 
  
 ### Linux

On Linux, local users can be enumerated through the use of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file which is world readable. In mac, this same file is only used in single-user mode in addition to the <code>/etc/master.passwd</code> file.

Also, groups can be enumerated through the <code>groups</code> and <code>id</code> commands.</blockquote>

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

Atomic Test #1 - Enumerate all accounts

cat /etc/passwd > #{output_file}

Atomic Test #2 - View sudoers access

cat /etc/sudoers > #{output_file}

Atomic Test #3 - View accounts with UID 0

username=$(echo $HOME | awk -F'/' '{print $3}') && lsof -u $username

lsof $USER

Atomic Test #4 - Show if a user account has ever logger in remotely

lastlog > #{output_file}

Atomic Test #5 - Enumerate users and groups

groups

id


## Data sources required to detect the attack

bash_history logs 


## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### bash_history 

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history cat /etc/passwd | table host,user_name,bash_command

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history cat /etc/sudoers | table host,user_name,bash_command

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history "lsof -u *" | table host,user_name,bash_command

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history lastlog | table host,user_name,bash_command

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history group OR id | table host,user_name,bash_command

## Caution/Caveat 


Note: This alerts should be seen in the context and not as isolated as these commands are used often by sys admins for legit operations daily.
