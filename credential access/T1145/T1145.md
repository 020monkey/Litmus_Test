# T1145 - Private Keys
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1145)
<blockquote>Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. (Citation: Wikipedia Public Key Crypto)

Adversaries may gather private keys from compromised systems for use in authenticating to [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email. Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc. Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as <code>~/.ssh</code> for SSH keys on * nix-based systems or <code>C:\Users\(username)\.ssh\</code> on Windows.

Private keys should require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056) for keylogging or attempt to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) the passphrase off-line.

Adversary tools have been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates. (Citation: Kaspersky Careto) (Citation: Palo Alto Prince of Persia) \</blockquote>

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

**Private Keys:**

find / -type f \( -name "*.pem" -o -name "*.pgp" -o -name "*.gpg" -o -name "*.ppk" -o -name "*.p12" -o -name "*.key" -o -name "*.pfx" -o -name "*.cer" -o -name "*.p7b" -o -name "*.asc" -o -name "authorized*"  \)

**look for Users' SSH Private Key:** find / -name id_rsa OR find / -name id_dsa

**Copy Private SSH Keys with CP:** find / -name id_rsa -exec cp --parents {} #{output_folder} \;

find / -name id_dsa -exec cp --parents {} #{output_folder} \;

**Copy Private SSH Keys with rsync:** 

find / -name id_rsa -exec rsync -R {} #{output_folder} \;

find / -name id_dsa -exec rsync -R {} #{output_folder} \;


## Data sources required to detect the attack

bash_history logs 

## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### bash_history 

index=* sourcetype=bash_history find AND (.pem OR authorized OR gpg OR pgp OR .ppk OR .cer OR .key OR .asc)

index=* sourcetype=bash_history find AND (id_rsa OR id_dsa)
