# T1081 - Credentials in Files
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1081)
<blockquote>Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing passwords. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.

It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). (Citation: CG 2014) Passwords may also be obtained from Group Policy Preferences stored on the Windows Domain Controller. (Citation: SRD GPP)</blockquote>

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

grep -riP password #{file_path}


grep -riP password /

## Data sources required to detect the attack

auditlogs (audit.rules)

bash_history logs 


## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### auditlogs(syscalls)

index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit type=execve a0=grep password

### bash_history 

index=linux sourcetype="bash_history" grep password | table host,user_name,bash_command
