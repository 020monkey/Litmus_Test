# T1139 - Bash History
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1139)
<blockquote>Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s <code>.bash_history</code> file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: <code>~/.bash_history</code>. Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Attackers can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials. (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way)</blockquote>

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

cat #{bash_history_filename} | grep #{bash_history_grep_args} > #{output_file}

cat .bash_history | grep password > bash.txt

## Data sources required to detect the attack

auditlogs (audit.rules)

bash_history logs 


## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### auditlogs(syscalls)

index=linux sourcetype="linux_audit" syscall=257 key=bash_history_changes | table host,auid,syscall,syscall_name,exe

### bash_history 

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history cat bash_history | table _time,host,user_name,bash_command
