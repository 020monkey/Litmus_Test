# T1110 - Brute Force
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1110)
<blockquote>Adversaries may use brute force techniques to attempt access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.

[Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) to obtain password hashes may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1075) is not an option. Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network. (Citation: Wikipedia Password cracking)

Adversaries may attempt to brute force logins without knowledge of passwords or hashes during an operation either with zero knowledge or by attempting a list of known or possible passwords. This is a riskier option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

A related technique called password spraying uses one password, or a small list of passwords, that matches the complexity policy of the domain and may be a commonly used password. Logins are attempted with that password and many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 



## Data sources required to detect the attack

/var/log/secure


## log patterns to detect the various attack/activities related to authentication 

 **Invalid User's attempt:** 
 ```
 Invalid user koza from <src_ip> port 55403
 ```
**If Password Authentication is enabled,for failed attempt:** 
```
Failed password for master from <src_ip> port 55568 ssh2
```
**If Password Authentication is enabled,for successful attempt:** 
```
Accepted password for master from <src_ip> port 55568 ssh2
```
**If ssh-key based authentication enabled, for fialed attempt:** 
```
Connection closed by <src_ip> port 55543 [preauth]
```
**If ssh-key based authentication enabled, for successful attempt:** 
```
Accepted publickey for ec2-user from <src_ip> port 55289 ssh2: RSA SHA256:kxVVnv/vCqMgGVgb9EMpjup2UEzaBRv1CdHU2KpKiDQ
```
**For each successful Sudo attempt**
```
sudo: ec2-user : TTY=pts/4 ; PWD=/home/ec2-user ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su

su: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user root by ec2-user(uid=0)
```

**Auth failure for Sudo su** 
```
sudo: pam_unix(sudo:auth): authentication failure; logname=ec2-user uid=1004 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/4 ruser=splunk rhost=  user=splunk

sudo: pam_unix(sudo:auth): authentication failure; logname=ec2-user uid=1004 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/4 ruser=splunk rhost=  user=splunk
```
**for NOT In Sudoers**
```
sudo:  splunk : user NOT in sudoers ; TTY=pts/4 ; PWD=/home/ec2-user ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su

sudo:  splunk : user NOT in sudoers ; TTY=pts/4 ; PWD=/home/ec2-user ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/etc/shadow
```
**Successful Switch User (su)** 
```
su: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user splunk by ec2-user(uid=1000)
```
**UNSuccessful Switch User (su)** 
```
**Command** ec2-user$su splunk 

**log**su: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname=ec2-user uid=1000 euid=0 tty=pts/4 ruser=ec2-user rhost=  user=splunk
```
```
**command** ec2-user$su master

**log** su: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname=ec2-user uid=1000 euid=0 tty=pts/4 ruser=ec2-user rhost=  user=master
```

**Modification(add,delete,permissions ) to key groups like SA/wheel** 
```
usermod[5019]: add 'splunk' to group 'wireshark'

gpasswd[5316]: user splunk added by root to group wireshark

gpasswd[5728]: user splunk removed by root from group wireshark
 ```
