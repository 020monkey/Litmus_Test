# T1156 - .bash_profile and .bashrc
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1156)
<blockquote><code>~/.bash_profile</code> and <code>~/.bashrc</code> are executed in a user's context when a new shell opens or when a user logs in so that their environment is set correctly. <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed for login shells and <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed for interactive non-login shells. This means that when a user logs in (via username and password) to the console (either locally or remotely via something like SSH), <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is executed before the initial command prompt is returned to the user. After that, every time a new shell is opened, <code>~/.bashrc</code> is executed. This allows users more fine grained control over when they want certain commands executed.

Mac's Terminal.app is a little different in that it runs a login shell by default each time a new terminal window is opened, thus calling <code>~/.bash_profile</code> each time instead of <code>~/.bashrc</code>.

These files are meant to be written to by the local user to configure their own environment; however, adversaries can also insert code into these files to gain persistence each time a user logs in or opens a new shell  (Citation: amnesia malware).</blockquote>

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

echo "#{command_to_add}" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "#{command_to_add}" >> ~/.bash_profile

echo "/home/ec2-user/welcome.sh" >>~/.bash_profile
echo "/home/ec2-user/welcome.sh" >>~/.bashrc

## Data sources required to detect the attack

auditlogs (audit.rules)

bash_history logs 


## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### auditlogs(syscalls)
index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit bashrc_changes

#### Audit-rules 
-w /home/ec2-user/.bashrc -p wa -k bashrc_changes

-w /home/ec2-user/.bash_profile -p wa -k bashrc_changes

### bash_history 

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history bash_command="nano .bashrc" OR bash_command="vi .bashrc" OR echo .bashrc | table host,user_name,bash_command

index=linux sourcetype=bash_history bash_command="nano .bashrc_profile" OR bash_command="vi .bashrc_profile" OR echo .bashrc_profile | table host,user_name,bash_command

## Caution

#### Note: 
We need to add audit rules for each users' bashrc & bash_profile files under their home locations.Wildcard expression (*) is not accepted in the audit.rules so we can NOT create a rule that watches the path = /home/*/.bash_history
