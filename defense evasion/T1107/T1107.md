# T1107 - File Deletion
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1107)
<blockquote>Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. Examples include native [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) functions such as DEL, secure deletion tools such as Windows Sysinternals SDelete, or other third-party file deletion tools.

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

rm -rf test1.text

rm -f test1.txt

shred -u test1.txt

## Data sources required to detect the attack

auditlogs (audit.rules)

bash_history logs 


## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### auditlogs(syscalls)

index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit syscall=59 comm=shred | table host,auid,msg

index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit type=execve shred .bash_history | table host,msg,a0,a2

index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit syscall=263 | table host,auid,uid,eid,exe

index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit syscall=82 exe=/usr/bin/shred | table host,auid,uid,eid,exe

#### Audit-rules 

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve,execveat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=program_execution

-w /home/ec2-user/.bash_history -p rwa -k bash_history_changes

### bash_history 

index=linux sourcetype="bash_history" bash_command="rm *"

index=linux sourcetype="bash_history" bash_command="shred -u *"
## Caution/Caveate
