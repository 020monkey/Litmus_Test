# T1055 - Process Injection
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1055)
<blockquote>Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
  
  ### Mac and Linux

Implementations for Linux and OS X/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)

* **LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH** (Linux), **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process.

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

echo #{path_to_shared_library} > /etc/ld.so.preload

echo /home/$USER/random.so > /etc/ld.so.preload

## Data sources required to detect the attack

auditlogs (audit.rules)

bash_history logs 


## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### auditlogs(syscalls)

index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit preload_lib

##### Audit Rue to catch this 

-w /etc/ld.so.preload -p wa -k preload_lib

### bash_history 

index=linux sourcetype="bash_history" ld.so.preload | table host,user_name,bash_command

## Caution/Caveat 

#### Note:
