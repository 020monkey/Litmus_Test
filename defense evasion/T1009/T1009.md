# T1009 - Binary Padding
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1009)
<blockquote>Some security tools inspect files with static signatures to determine if they are known malicious. Adversaries may add data to files to increase the size beyond what security tools are capable of handling or to change the file hash to avoid hash-based blacklists.</blockquote>

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 

dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=1 >> #{file_to_pad}

sha1sum welcome.sh >before

dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=1 >> welcome.sh

<<
1+0 records in

1+0 records out

1 byte (1 B) copied, 0.000221464 s, 4.5 kB/s

>>

sha1sum welcome.sh >after

cmp before after

<<before after differ: byte 1, line 1>>
