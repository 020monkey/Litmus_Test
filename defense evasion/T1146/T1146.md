# T1146 - Clear Command History
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1146)
<blockquote>macOS and Linux both keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can easily remember what they've done. These logs can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions. Since everything typed on the command-line is saved, passwords passed in on the command line are also saved. Adversaries can abuse this by searching these files for cleartext passwords. Additionally, adversaries can use a variety of methods to prevent their own commands from appear in these logs such as <code>unset HISTFILE</code>, <code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>, <code>history -c</code>, <code>rm ~/.bash_history</code>.</blockquote>

# How to Detect  

## Simulating the attack 
```
rm ~/.bash_history
```
```
echo " " > .bash_history
```
```
cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history
```
```
ln -sf /dev/null ~/.bash_history
```
```
truncate -s0 ~/.bash_history
```
```
unset HISTFILE
```
```
export HISTFILESIZE=0
```
```
history -c
```
## Data sources required to detect the attack

auditlogs (audit.rules)

bash_history logs 

## Splunk Queries to detect the attack

### auditlogs(syscalls)

#### rm -rf  ~/.bash_history 
```
index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit syscall=263 | table time,host,auid,uid,euid,exe,key

index=linux sourcetype=linux_audit type=PATH name=.bash_history nametype=delete | table time,name,nametype
```
#### echo " " > .bash_history
```
index=linux sourcetype="linux_audit" bash_history_changes exe!=/home/ec2-user/splunk/bin/splunkd syscall=257 a2!=0 AND a3!=0 | table host,syscall,syscall_name,exe,auid
```
#### Note: 

a2!=0 and a3!=0 are added in to the query to distinuish echo and cat - both logs Systemcall 257 (openat). Morover, when a user logsin through ssh - SYSCALL 257 is used with exe=/usr/bin/bash (2 events generated)for /home/$USER/.bash_history; however in that case the command arguments a2=0 and a3=0 ; when we use command "echo " "> .bash_history"  the same systemcall (257) and the same exe = /usr/bin/bash is used however command arguments a2!=0 and a3!=0.

index=linux sourcetype="linux_audit" bash_history_changes exe!=/home/ec2-user/splunk/bin/splunkd syscall=257 exe=/usr/bin/bash a2!=0 AND a3!=0| table host,syscall,syscall_name,exe,auid

#### Audit-rules 
```
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F PATH=/home/ec2-user/.bash_history -S unlinkat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=delete_bash_history

-w /home/ec2-user/.bash_history -p rwa -k bash_history_changes
```
### bash_history 
```
index=linux sourcetype="bash_history"  "rm * .bash_history"
```
## Caution

#### Note: 
Note: We need to add the rule for each users' bash_history  file under their home location.  Wildcard expression (*) is not accepted in the audit.rules so we can NOT create a rule that watches the path = /home/*/.bash_history
